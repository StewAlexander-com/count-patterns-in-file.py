# count-patterns-in-file.py
Project to create a way to search files for specific patterns in a file
```
This file counts the number of times a string appears in a file
of the users choosing, and prints this amount,
then the program saves the line numbers (and the line number contents) found
to a file called "line_numbers.txt"
```
---
* Reason for creating this was to able to search yaml files created by SaltStack for specific information when a better editor wasn't available
* For instance this script can be run via the app "Pythonista" on iPhones and iPads, etc
