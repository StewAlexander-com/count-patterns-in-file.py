# count-patterns-in-file.py
Project to create a way to search files for specific patterns in a file
```
This file counts the number of times a string appears in a filename, prints the result then saves the line numbers found
to a file called "line_numbers.txt"
```
---
* Reason for creating this was to able to search yaml files created by SaltStack for specific information
